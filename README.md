# Speed Estimation

Working on a real-time Vehicle Speed Detection System using YOLO + Perspective Transform + ByteTrack.
This project can estimate vehicle speed accurately by mapping the camera view to a top-down perspective.

Still improving the model, but excited to share the progress! 🚗💨
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. 🙌
